Before getting into custom or template websites, will try to throw a little light on what is a custom built website and template website.

## Custom website

Custom website design involves doing everything from scratch to cater to the specific needs of the client. A team is involved right from designing the look and feel of the website to its functionality part.It's a long process involving time, money and labour and is unique

## Template website

On the other hand template websites are readily available resources with layouts and features already designed.There are quite a lot of template providers in the market who make it available for free or for some price for the businesses to use.The developers just have to change content and add on some plugin and make it available to the clients.

Now that we have an understanding of template and custom website design, let’s just take a closer look and analyse where to use what.

When the client is particular about the brand identity and the feel of the website with respect to the logo, style and target audience it's better to go with a custom template. They stand out from the crowd and give you a competitive edge over the others. custom design is the best bet when it comes to serious e-commerce and improving organic traffic through SEO. A custom website also grows when your company grows as you can customise the website wherever and whenever necessary. Once the website is built, the work doesn’t stop there, it requires maintenance and upkeep, which is taken care of.

When the client is not very specific about the look or the functionality of the website you can go for template design but yes, you also end up with the same design as many others in the market. When cost or time is a constraint then you can choose to go with template design as they are already predesigned pages with basic functionality, available in wide varieties from which you can pick and choose the one which best suits the client’s requirements. If you are setting up a much easier site without knowing HTML and CSS, the template will do the trick as it usually comes with large amounts of built-in functionality, widgets, and options.

To sum up, template design is less time consuming and cost-effective but most templates are not SEO friendly and customisation is limited and there is no 100% guarantee that it will work on all devices.

On the other hand, custom design has a competitive edge because of its uniqueness, can be customised and enhanced as per the client’s requirements. On the flip side, it involves quite a lot of time, money and labour to build one as everything needs to be done from scratch.

So, which is the best one? This is better left to the discretion of the creator or developer as he knows client requirements and available resources to meet them. Whatever may be the means, exercising honesty and transparency with the clients will bring in consistent success as a business is a long term process.
